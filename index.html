	<div id="description"> Hello, welcome to my website! <br> <br>
		I'm a third-year student at the University of Wyoming pursuing degrees in Statistics and Computer Science with a minor in honors. 
		Naturally as a stats and cs student, I'm interested in how data can offer clever insights into problems. This has ranged from
		sports analytics research at Carnegie Mellon to research in automated algorithm selection and AI here at UW. 
		My projects section contains more details about the different research projects I've worked on in the last few years.<br> <br>
		Beyond academia, I enjoy backpacking and tail running. In my hobbies section you'll find a selection of some of my favorite trips.
