	<div id="description"> Hello, welcome to my personal portfolio website!  <br> <br>
		I'm a third-year student at the University of Wyoming pursuing degrees in Statistics and Computer Science with a minor in honors. 
		Naturally, as a stats and comp-sci student, I'm interested in how data can offer clever insights into challenging problems.
		Exploring this interest, I'm working on research in automated algorithm selection at UW, 
		and I worked on research in sports analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. 
		My projects section contains more details about my work in the MALLET lab, Carnegie Mellon, and some personal interest projects.<br> <br>
		Beyond academia, I enjoy backpacking and trail running. In the "Other" section you'll find a selection of some of my favorite trips.
