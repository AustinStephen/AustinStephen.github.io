						Hello, <br> <br>
						I am humbled you found your way to my website. 
						Here I exibit some of my projects from the past few years. 
						Together they tell the story of what excites me about solving problems through the lens of statistics and computer science. 
						You may find my interests sporatic or fortuitous with works ranging from sports analytics at Carnegie Mellon to AutoML here at UW. 
						Yet, undercoring this incongruency is my passion for leveraging data to abstract information out of curious questions. 
						<br> <br>
						If you are looking for a place to start, I recommend "Tired of Misattribution, Fatigue in the NBA".
						My favorite part of this project is the way I exploited my knowledge of kinematics to address problems in a seemingly unrelated problem domain. 
						<br> <br>

						Outside of academic pursuits, I enjoy backpacking and trail running. If you are curious about what this looks like 
						in Wyoming and Colorado, in the "Other" section, you'll find a selection of some of my favorite trips. 
						Please reach out if you think we have some mutual interests, and I would love to talk about them.  <br> <br>
