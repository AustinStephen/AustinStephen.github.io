		Welcome to my website!  <br> <br>  
		
		I'm interested in automated machine learning, applications of statistics, and statistical computing.
		I use this website to exhibit past and current projects. <br> <br>

		Currently, I split my time between Eye-to-Eye Telehealth and the Meta-Algorithmics, Learning, and Large-scale Empirical Testing Lab (<a href="http://mallet.ai/index.html"> MALLET</a>) at the University of Wyoming. 
		In the MALLET lab, I'm exploring automated approaches to identify substrata of data and leveraging these substrata to improve predictive models. Before my current work, I participated in an REU at Carnegie Mellon University working with NBA data on player fatigue. 
		I also interned at Goldman Sachs as a software engineer where I worked on distributed computing software. <br> <br>
		 
		Outside of academic pursuits, I enjoy backpacking and trail running. If you are curious about what this looks like 
		in Wyoming and Colorado; in the "Other" section, you'll find a selection of some of my favorite trips.
