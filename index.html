<img id="photo" src="./images/Portrait2.JPG" alt="Phtoto of Austin Stephen">
<p id="decription"> I'm a second-year student at the University of Wyoming 
pursuing degrees in Statistics and Computer Science with a minor in honors. 
I'm broadly interested in data-driven approaches to problem-solving and software development.
Exploring this interest, I currently work with a research group at the University of Wyoming in the MALLET Lab. 
My research focuses on the meta-algorithmic technique of automated algorithm selection.<br>
In my free time I enjoy hiking, trail running, skiing and traveling.
