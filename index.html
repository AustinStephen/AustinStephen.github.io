		Welcome to my website!  <br> <br>  
		
		I use this as an archive of projects from over the years. My background is in statistics and computer science, so most of the problems I've worked on live somewhere at that intersection. 
<br> <br>
		In school, I spent several years in the MALLET Lab at the University of Wyoming, working on AutoML and algorithm selection. I also did and REU at CMU and an internship at Goldman Sachs in both I got to work on some interesting problems. 
		These days, I lead much of the engineering effort at Eye to Eye, where we're building a rebound tonometer.
<br> <br>
		There's a lot happening at E2E so if you're interested in medical devices, feel free to reach out. We are always looking for talented people to join our team.
