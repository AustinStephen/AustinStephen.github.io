						Hello, <br> <br>
						I am humbled you found your way to my website. 
						I use this space to exhibit past and current projects. 
						Broadly, I'm interested in automating statistical learning, applications of statistics, and statistical computing. 
						Exploring these interests, I interned at Goldman Sachs as a software engineer, and participated in an REU at Carnegie Mellon University.
						Currently I'm finishing my 4th year at the University of Wyoming pursuing a double major in computer science and statistics.
						I'm also working in the Meta-Algorithmics, Learning and Large-scale Empirical Testing Lab (<a href="http://mallet.ai/index.html"> MALLET</a>) at the University of Wyoming and as a data scientist at Eye-To-Eye Telehealth.
						In the MALLET lab I'm exploring automated approaches to identify partitions of data governed by different underlying distributions.
						More specifically, I'm investigating how large datasets generated by potentially different fundamental mechanisms can be better characterized not by a single function but by multiple completely different functions. <br> <br>     

						Outside of academic pursuits, I enjoy backpacking and trail running. If you are curious about what this looks like 
						in Wyoming and Colorado, in the "Other" section, you'll find a selection of some of my favorite trips. 
						Please reach out if you think we have some mutual interests, and I would love to talk about them.  <br> <br>
